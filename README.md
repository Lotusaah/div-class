HI I am Victor Davis. 
This was a project made for my diversity leadership class. We were tasked with making a leadership Manual.
My professor wanted us to be creative so I made a website. ALL CONTENT WAS INTENTEDS TO SPREAD AWARNESS AND IF
THERE IS ANY MISTAKES WITH CORRECTNESS PLEASE LET ME NOW. I AM STILL LEARNING. For the website part it was made with
react js and tailwindcss and deploded on an aws instance. 

Thank You.
